# Localizer

Convert a set of excel (localization) files into a text format based file containing the ID table.
It is then used by the Compiler to convert LString instances to an ID.

## Output

The Localizer will immediately output a binary string table for each language. Each language will have a separate file.
A main file will be created containing the list of output filenames.

## TODO

Change to use https://github.com/ExcelDataReader/ExcelDataReader
